Submittable API Client
######################

A Python client for the Submittable.com REST API.

Submittable.com is a service that allows you to post application and
submission forms for users to fill in. They allow you to collect payments
for submissions, assign staff to review submissions, and generally provide
the needed workflow for accepting applications or submissions for your
organization.

This API client is designed to leverage the Submittable REST API via Python
scripts for various tasks and management duties. The API provided by
Submittable.com is currently read-only, so this client does not cover creating
any data.
